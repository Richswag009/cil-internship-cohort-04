## Question 1:

What is the NS IP addresses for facebook, goolge and tesla?

### Ans:

NS stands for ‘nameserver,’ and the nameserver record indicates which DNS server is
authoritative for that domain (i.e., which server contains the actual DNS records).
Basically, NS records tell the Internet where to go to find out a domain's IP address. A
domain often has multiple NS records which can indicate primary and secondary
nameservers for that domain. Without properly configured Ns records, users will be unable to load a website or application
