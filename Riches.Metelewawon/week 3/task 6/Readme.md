### QUESTION 1:

Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of it's benefits in software development

### Ans:

Scrum is a software product development strategy that organizes software developer as a team to reach a common goal - creating a ready-for-market product. it describes a set of meetings, tools and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.

it encourages team to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem and reflect on their wins and losses to continously improve.

## Benefits of using Scrum

1. Clearly Defined sprint goal: Every sprint interval has a clearly defined set of goals that the scrum team establishes during the sprint planning meeting. its essential to both set these goals and to make them realistic. to craft realistic goals, a team should weigh bothe the teams capacity for each particular sprint and the amount of work the team hopes to accomplish

2. Developer Growth: one of the benefit of scrum is it enables a team to hold a periodic hacking sprint. this is when developers team up or work individually on a piece of code that is related to the overall product but that isnt directly tied to a product feature. this sprint allows the team to brainstorm and implement new concepts learn code or text techniques

3. Flexibility to allow quick product changes: the capability to quickly adapt to changes in product definition and to deliver to those changes within a few iterations is a key benefit to scrum. to enable the adaption, the scrum teams creates or modifies backlog items to align with the needed product changes. the team then grooms - or re-grooms these items to ensure scope, clarity and sizing

4. Reduced Risk: scrum provides the opportunity tot recognize and mistigate risk early in the process through cross functional teams , sustainable and predictable delivery pace, continuous feedback and good practices
